2025-06-26 07:59:42+00:00,@simonecanciello You're doing it wrong if it mentally drains you: Schedule a weekly timeblock for 15-30 minutes to create and schedule content (use Typefully so you don't have to visit this site here). Then schedule a timeblock for 15 minutes everyday to catch up with other people and engage.
